## About

The NFT Social Hub is place where current or future NFT holders no matter what type of NFT can join and shire information about their project. Users that create an account will be able to post, like, comment and follow other users to keep track of projects they are interested in.
This Hub is for all holders to share their thoughts and collaborate with each other.


## Project Goals

The goal of this project was to create a hub where NFT holders can join and share their projects and collaborate with each other. There is currently no site like this out there specific to NFTs where it is focused on the project and allowing users to find potential future projects they would like to follow. 

Required functions that the social hub required:

1. Good user experience and a clear understanding of the user flow,
2. User engagement (posting, liking, disliking, commenting, following, subscribing),
3. User login authentication status,
4. Full CRUD functionality for posts, comments, likes, followers and profile data,
5. Profiles that could be personalised (images, bio),
7. Filtering posts by search functionality of data related to a post (title, user),
8. Like filtering by viewing all previously liked posts,
9. Feed filtering by viewing all followed user's posts,
10. Responsive site for desktop and mobile.


## User Stories

#### Navigation & Authentication (Project Goal # Covered: 1, 8)

1. As a user I can view a navbar from every page so that I can navigate easily between pages,
2. As a user I can navigate through pages quickly so that I can view content seamlessly without page refresh,
3. As a user I can create a new account so that I can access all the features for signed up users,
4. As a user I can sign in to the app so that I can access functionality for logged in users,
5. As a user I can tell if I am logged in or not so that I can log in if I need to,
6. As a user I can maintain my logged-in status until I choose to log out so that my user experience is not compromised,
7. As a logged out user I can see sign in and sign up options so that I can sign in/sign up,
8. As a user I can view user's avatars so that I can easily identify users of the application,
